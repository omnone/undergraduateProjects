I’m an only child so I loved getting to marry into Cody’s huge family! I know sometimes mothers-in-law get a bad rap, but I love Cody’s mom and am thankful for how sweet and supportive she is! I’ve learned a lot from her and today I wanted to share 6 things my mother-in-law has taught me:\r\nLesson 1. Laugh at yourself, and don’t take things too seriously. Her boys are always playing jokes and pranks on each other and that attitude, to be quick to laugh, is so contagious!\r\nLesson 2. Family is everything. She has 8 kids. 8!! She’s a great example of how to put first things first – and number one is always family. She is always making sure everyone gets together and she looks forward to family time more than anything!\r\nLesson 3. How to make the best homemade cinnamon rolls. Ok well I haven’t totally mastered it yet, but she taught Cody how to make them so I still get to reap the benefits! Her cinnamon rolls are magic and she makes them on special family occasions, but always every Christmas morning.\r\n\r\nLesson 4. Don’t be afraid to say what you want or speak your mind. Luedeen is never afraid to speak her mind, and I love that about her!\r\n\r\nLesson 5. Start your Christmas shopping early! She has over 40 people in the family (just kids and grandkids – not including extended family) and she buys gifts for every single one of them. Her secret is to start months in advance so when the holidays come around, she can really enjoy time with the family instead of stressing about gifts. It’s such a great idea, so even though I’m a procrastinator at heart I try to follow her lead. I love browsing the aisles to find the best stocking stuffers. I always end up grabbing this Burt’s Bees Essentials Kit at Walmart – everyone always needs travel sized everything. The hand salve is a life saver, and you can never have enough chapsticks! We also bet foot massages on pretty much everything, so the foot cream comes in handy too. (Also with the chaos of the holidays it’s sometimes easier to pick up whatever you need for your holiday shopping online.)\r\n\r\nLesson 6. Gift bags are your best friend.

Give it even more of a boho bride style by adding in pretty pink accents like these raw crystals. With floating candles and the softest touch of blush blooms, the Velluto fabric sets a perfect canvas for this design. Just like this setting, it’s a great way to bring cool fall feels to a tropical setting!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\r\n\r\nNow, for those looking to go all in on fall colors, we love a deep Ruby red like our Wine Velluto. It sets the mood for a lively holiday feast or a romantic wedding reception.\r\n\r\nPaired with our French country-inspired linen Maison Dining Chairs, this color palette creates a rich\r\natmosphere for dinner guests, especially when set against beautiful blooming Bougainvillea!\r\n\r\nBring in more of those gorgeous jewel tones in purples and oranges across the tabletop and use copper toned accents to tie the look together!\r\n\r\nSo whatever your event is this season, bring in those fall feelings with an array of gemstone-hued linens in soft velvet-inspired fabrics to really amp up the party.

While I was shooting this the leaf-blowing truck pulled up and started blowing all the leaves away from the street – I didn’t know know that was a thing haha but apparently they have to do it every day during the fall since there are so many leaves falling.

Anyone else already thinking about planning a trip somewhere warm? I’m not ready for all the colorful leaves to disappear either! It’s my favorite part of fall. While I was shooting this the leaf-blowing truck pulled up and started blowing all the leaves away from the street – I didn’t know know that was a thing haha but apparently they have to do it every day during the fall since there are so many leaves falling. So it’s crazy to think all these leaves are just from ONE DAY!&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;\r\nYou guys may recognize this look from when I shared it a couple weeks ago on Instagram, but honestly pics don’t do the pieces justice. They are an investment but all of the pieces have so much detail – they are amazing in real life. I discovered Fabiana Fillipi last year. Remember this outfit? I fell in love with their collection and they quickly became some of my favorite designers. This top is probably my favorite. I love the combination collar and it’s so simple but really high quality so it can transform any outfit you pair it with. Also love the beaded hem on this trouser. It’s crazy what a difference little details make but they really do! This trench is super softer and also reversible, with a grey or camel option – so pretty. Also obsessed with the detailing on this coat. Below are some more of my favorites!&lt;/p&gt;','','The Best Street','','');
